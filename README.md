# Probabilistic Circuits for Minimal-Feature Explanations

A research project (11/2024–05/2025) exploring probabilistic circuits and gradient-based optimisation to find the smallest set of features that still explains a model’s predictions in generative and multi-label settings.

> TL;DR: We build a mathematically grounded method that keeps accuracy high while using fewer features. In our experiments, we reached 85%% accuracy using only ~60%% of features, improving authentication efficiency by ~40%%.

## Overview
This repository tracks the end-to-end research workflow: problem framing, theory, algorithms, Julia implementation, experiments, and a short write-up.

## Motivation
Modern models are accurate but hard to interpret. We want faithful, compact explanations: minimal feature subsets that preserve a model’s prediction or likelihood under uncertainty.
